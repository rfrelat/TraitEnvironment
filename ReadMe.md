All tutorials use the same example from fish communities in the Northeast Atlantic. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfrelat/TraitEnvironment/master/Data/NEAtl_FishTraitEnv.Rdata).  Every tutorial can be followed independently, in any order. All resources use [R software](https://cran.r-project.org/) and require basic knowledge of the R language.
